# EduRate: Feedback Tool

## Introduction

Welcome to the EduRate...
The web application "EduRate" aims to enable speakers to easily obtain feedback from the audience by first creating an entry for the respective event and then retrieving a QR code that takes the audience to a rating page.
The application only runs locally for the time being: To start the application, it is necessary to start the server (server.js) with the command "npm start". The React frontend runs with "Vite" and can be started with the command "npm run dev". Finally, the console displays the localhost URL under which the web pages can be called up in the browser.
